# My first repository
# TO write Code for following problem in any Language(C,C++,Java,Python...):
Problem:
      We have been given four integers x,y,p & q. To determine if there exists binary string having x 0's and y 1's such that the total number of subsequences equal to the sequence "01" in it is a and the total number of subsequences equal to the sequence "10" in it is b.
      
      Input Format:
      1. First line contains T test cases(1<=T<=10^5)
      2. Each test case contains four integers x,y,p & q((0<=x,y<=10^5),(0<=p,q<=10^9))
      
      Output Format:
       For each test case, output "YES" if a string with given conditions exists and "NO" otherwise.
